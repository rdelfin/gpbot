    FIRST. It's a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the \
    value of others, and respects individuals and the community. With Gracious \
    Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions. \
    Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy but treat one another with \
    respect and kindness in the process. They avoid treating anyone like losers. No \
    chest thumping tough talk, but no sticky-sweet platitudes either. Knowledge, \
    competition, and empathy are comfortably blended. In the long run, Gracious \
    Professionalism is part of pursuing a meaningful life. One can add to society and \
    enjoy the satisfaction of knowing one has acted with integrity and sensitivity.";
